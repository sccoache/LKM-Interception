# LKM-interception

To compile the files, run make with the Makefile in the present directory. The Makefile will create a .ko file (Different versions for each part of the assignment). Execute the makeful to create the .ko file. Run "sudo insmod [.ko file]" to insert the system call interception. To remove it, call "sudo rmmod [.ko file]".

Part 2 of the assignment included text files that can be piped into the program using standard terminal notation, ie: ./p2<test.txt

The assignment consistst of simple alterations to existing system calls. Every time a regular user opens or closes a file, the program will print this information to the system log. However, we do not want this to happen for non-user actions (such as those by the root user, known service user accounts, etc.). Accordingly, we intercepted and modified the existing system calls for open and close to add kprint statements for regular users. In the syslog, the open messages should look like Jan 6 18:24:52 kernel: [ 105.033521] User 1000 is opening file: /etc/motd, while the close messages may look like Jan 6 18:24:53 kernel: [ 108.511234] User 1000 is closing file descriptor: 2. The program will also look at every read call to determine if the file contains the string VIRUS. If it does, it will write a warning to the system log such as: Jan 6 18:24:52 kernel: [ 105.033521] User 1000 read from file descriptor 2, but that file contained the word VIRUS!
